Rearrange Array Elements:
 The algorithm firsts sorts the list elements using a Merge Sort but, it sorts in
 reversed order (i.e)descending order.
 The Merge Sort was chosen as it always has O(nlogn) complexity.
 The expected time complexity is then O(nlogn).
 The Rearrange method then uses a greedy approach to build the two lists
 by alternatively placing elements into the two lists.If the element is odd it is
 placed in one list and if the element is even,in other,inorder to maintain a maximum
 difference of digits which is 1.

 Time Complexity:
   Merge sort=>O(nlogn)
   n nodes are iterated to form two digits=>O(n)
   Overall is O(n log n)
Space Complexity:
  mergesort n nodes + two digits variables +auxilary
  makes overall O(n)
