Max and Min in a Unsorted Array:
    The code must run in O(n).In a single traversal each element is checked whether
    it is the minimal element or the maximal element,by using extra two variables
    and initially they were set to 0,by comparing the value changes and finally ,
    we get the minimal and maximal value.
Time Complexity:
  O(n)
Space Complexity:
  since the same number variables are used, independent of the input array,
  the space complexity is O(1).
