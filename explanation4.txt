Dutch National Flag Problem
   The idea is to solve the problem using a single traversal.
   By swapping 0 and 2 nodes the 1 nodes will come in position automatically.
   Make front_index and next_pos_2 as variables and when 0 is found swap that value and add it
   in front,increment the front_index and the value in that node was put in the other node and if the value is
   2 decrement the next_pos_2 add it to the next_pos_2,By doing this we can achieve
   the whole list sorted.

Time Complexity:
   The sorting is accomplished in a single pass therefore time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
   Since the variabales are always the same ,it is independent of the input array
   The Space Complexity is O(1)
